# Mock API for Checkout

### Note

1. This API is not intelligent. Use this API for development only. Do not consider the responses sent by this API as final. Always check your branch on dark APIs.
1. Cookies are neither read or sent. If you want preferences for a non-logged-in user, rename `preferences.customer` key to something else.

### Instructions

1. Point Checkout to `localhost:5000` instead of `api.razorpay.com`

### Setup & Run

1. `npm i`
1. `npm run start`
